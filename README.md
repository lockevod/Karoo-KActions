## Notifications Configuration

KActions can send automatic messages when you start/stop your ride. **You need to have connected your Karoo with the mobile app (Karoo 3) or have a data connection (Karoo 2)**.

You need to configure basic information in Conf. Tab:

1. **Configure notification options**:
   - Enable or disable notifications for different events: start, end of the ride.
   - You've configure this for notifications and webhooks separately.

2. **Configure phone number**:
   - Add one phone numbers that will receive notifications.
   - Number should be entered with E164 format (with the '+' sign and with the country code example: +34675123123).

3. **Customize messages**:
   - Personalize messages for each type of event.
   - You can fill Custom Message also, this is for sending custom messages directly from your ride when you want. If you insert/write #dist# in your text, this will be substitute for remaining distance (you need to have a route selected also)
   
4. **Select actions**:
    - Start, stop or both.
    - Enable only in outdoors activities (only karoo > 1.5481)

5. **Select time betweem messages**:
    - You can configure time between two messages, this is for avoid to receive several messages, you can configure it but minimum time is 5 minutes (internal delay).

6. **Live Track**:
   - Fill Live Track Karoo key. If you fill this, you will receive the link with your tracking info you need to fill only the key. For example:
   https://dashboard.hammerhead.io/live/3738Ag, please fill only 3738Ag

7. **During your ride**:
   - Once configured, KActions will automatically send messages/execute webhook when you start or end a ride on your Karoo.
   - You don't need to interact with the app during the ride; everything works in the background.


Webhook and Custom Message can be triggered pressing the button in the app if you add custom field in the profiles screen. Button works:
1. Push the button in the app to activate the webhook or send a custom message.
2. If you push the button before 8 seconds, the app will send a custom message.
3. If you push the button after 8 seconds, the app will configure to send a webhook.
4. If you wait more than 30 seconds, the app will reset the button and you need to push again.

This button has a security measure (for webhook action only), you have to press twice to send the webhook (and you can configure to be triggered only if you're near home)

KActions supports several providers to send notifications, you need to configure before use the app:

### WhatsApp (CallMeBot) Preferred option (easy)

1. **Get your CallMeBot API Key**:
   - Visit [CallMeBot](https://www.callmebot.com/blog/free-api-whatsapp-messages/) and follow the instructions.
   - CallMeBot is free and you don't need to link your number (only has to send a message and you'll have the key code) but you can only use with one number, then you've to generate the key from the destination number (where you want to receive notifications).
   - If you want you can app the Callmebot number in your contacts with a more friendly name. Please, you can do this steps in receiver mobile not in yours.

2. **Configure KActions**:
   - Open KActions on your Karoo.
   - Select "WhatsApp (CallMeBot)" as the provider.
   - Enter your CallMeBot API Key.
   - Test CallMeBot configuration with Test Button.
  
### SMS (TextBelt). Second preferred option

1. **About TextBelt**:
   - TextBelt offers worldwide SMS sending.
   - The free version allows 1 SMS per day. This is easy but you can only send a sms and if there is some problem you cannot retry same day.
   - For more messages, you need to purchase credits at [TextBelt](https://textbelt.com/). 
   - You'll receive from different numbers (TextBelt has a significant pool number)

2. **Configure TextBelt in KActions**:

### WhatsApp (WHAPI) Complicated option but powerful.

1. **Create a Whapi account**:
   - Visit [Whapi.io](https://whapi.io/) and register.
   - Whapi isn't free but they've sandbox and it's free (aroung 1000 whats/month). Please read whapi conditions because you've to link a real number if you use a sandbox. If you don't understand it, please don't use it. It's easy but you need to understand risks. I will not provide more info about enrollment process.

   - Open KActions on your Karoo.
   - Select "WhatsApp (WHAPI)" as the provider.
   - Paste your API Key in the corresponding field.

## Webhook Configuration

KActions allows you to configure webhooks to execute external services when events occur during your ride (start/stop) or you can also execute it if you add webhook custom field in your profile. Webhook configuration is only for advanced users, it's very powerful (because you can execute action you want) but it's necessary you have experience. 

1. **Enable webhooks**:
   - In the webhook configuration screen, activate the "Enable webhook" option.
   - Enter a name to identify your webhook.

2a. **API/Webhook information**:
   - You need to have information about your service (url, post and headers)
   - Please check this info before next steps. You can use postman or other chrome extensions to check the correct behaviour.

2b. **Configure URL, data and headers**:
   - Enter the URL of the service that will receive the data.
   - Define the POST request body in JSON format.
   - Define Headers in JSON format.

3. **Triggering events**:
   - Select which events will trigger the webhook: start or end of ride.

4. **Location filter (optional)**:
   - You can configure the webhook to activate only when you're at at home location (POI Home in your Karoo).

5. **Webhook testing**:
   - Use the "Send test to webhook" function to verify the configuration.


## Import/Export API keys/Webhook Configuration

KActions allows you to import both provider configurations and webhook settings directly from a file. This is very useful if you've to introduce a complicated key or you webhook is complicated. You'll need to connect your Karoo by cable and execute adb commands.
You only need to use it if you want to import complex api keys. If you don't have any file to import, you can skip this step.

- **Import Provider Settings**:
   - Fill information in file (you've a template in templates folder. Please don't modify structure, change/complete only apikey (insert your apikey for your provider (between quotation marks). You don't need to fill a key for every provider. You can do copy with adb with the command:
   ```
   adb push provider_config.json /sdcard/Android/data/com.enderthor.kActions/files/provider_config.json
   ```
   - Copy the file to your Karoo device in the KActions folder (/sdcard/Android/data/com.enderthor.kActions/files/). You need to create this folder if it doesn't exist (you can use a file manager app or ADB).
   - Please respect the file name, it must to be "provider_config.json"
   - Access the Provider Configuration screen.
   - Tap the "Import Configuration" button.
   - The app will read settings from file.

- **Import Webhook Settings**:
     - Fill information in file (you've a template in templates folder. Please don't modify structure, change/complete only second position, for example, don't change "name", insert name after : between  quotation marks. You don't need to fill all fields.
     - Copy the file to your Karoo device in the KActions folder (/sdcard/Android/data/com.enderthor.kActions/files/). You don't need to create this folder if it doesn't exist (you can use a ADB and copy file directly). You can do copy with adb with the command:
     ```
     adb push webhook_config.json /sdcard/Android/data/com.enderthor.kActions/files/webhook_config.json
     ```
     - Please respect the file name, it must to be "webhook_config.json"
     - Access the Webhook Configuration screen.
     - Tap the "Import Webhooks" button.
     - The app will read webhook configurations from the previously exported file.

- This feature makes it easy to import api keys and webhooks information (but you and introduce directly by Karoo keyboard). Be careful, this file has sensitive information (api keys, phone numbers, etc.) and you should not share it with anyone.
- This feature only save basic information you need to configure/select rest of the options in the app (like messages, enable, etc.).
